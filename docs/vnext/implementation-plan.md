# KXM vNext implementation plan

This plan is ordered by contract dependency. A later phase MUST NOT weaken an
earlier phase's authority, recovery, isolation, or synchronization invariants.

## Phase 0: contract package

Deliver this directory, machine-readable schemas, a complete YAML fixture,
contract validation tests, lifecycle tables, effect rules, sync allowlists, and
the migration matrix.

**Gate:** schemas and examples validate; current behavior is clearly separated
from planned behavior.

## Phase 1: project configuration and initialization

Implement restricted YAML loading, project/repository discovery, resource
resolution, templates, three-way reconciliation, and idempotent `kxm init`.
Support create, join, repair, resume, and legacy JSON migration.

**Implemented slices:** restricted parsing, exact-schema and semantic bundle
validation, path-derived discovery, deterministic configuration hashing, init
state classification, atomic minimal creation, rewrite-free revalidation,
explicit join, and bounded Runtime-local member-repository binding persistence.
Repair reconciliation, resumable init, migration conversion/receipts, and
permission-diff trust remain pending; therefore the Phase 1 gate is not yet
passed.

**Gate:** a project can be reproduced from Git on a second machine without a
hub and without overwriting edited files.

## Phase 2: event-sourced local Runtime

Implement the per-user Runtime supervisor, authenticated local API, Runtime
registry, per-project SQLite event stores, projections, command idempotency,
outbox, auto-start, and crash recovery.

**Gate:** `kxm run` creates and recovers a local owned run with the hub absent.

## Phase 3: ordered workflow engine

Implement compiled sequential steps, typed bounded transitions, step attempts,
assignments, physical attempts, join rules, budgets, deterministic gates,
waits, approvals, steering, cancellation, and uncertain-effect handling.

**Gate:** a model-free test driver completes and recovers representative
workflows without illegal transitions or evidence reuse.

## Phase 4: Pi adapter and Pi-native UX

Implement Pi model/auth discovery, supervised RPC sessions, per-run
coordinators, scope epochs, tool presets, model profile/tag resolution, the Pi
status line, `/kxm` menu, settings, and validated agent/workflow/model editors.

**Gate:** `kxm init` followed by `kxm run default "prompt"` resolves the
materialized `default.yaml` and completes a single-repository Pi workflow with
visible local status.

## Phase 5: multi-repository local release

Ship the local Runtime track publicly beside, not on top of, the legacy hub
engine. Explicit `kxm init`/migration receipts activate vNext resources per
project; existing hub runs and mesh commands remain on their current contracts.

Implement worktrees, dirty snapshots, one-writer leases, multi-repository
bindings, default-derived environments, host secret grants, local logs,
repository-aware timing, patches/local commits, and non-atomic delivery
manifests.

**Gate:** the public local release runs a dirty two-repository workflow through
a Runtime crash without a hub or secret leakage.

## Phase 6: SSH and exe.dev

Implement a generic SSH executor, built-in exe.dev profile, versioned remote
helper, verified workspace transfer, event cursors, process reattachment,
secret grants, cleanup/retention, and uncertain remote-effect recovery.

**Gate:** one workflow produces equivalent contracts locally and through
exe.dev, including connection-loss recovery.

## Phase 7: MOA and local orchestration breadth

Implement provider-distinct model panels, all-settled joins, explicit diversity
degradation, bounded parallel assignments, disagreement-preserving synthesis,
and time/cost/transition budgets.

**Gate:** a three-provider review tolerates one failed member without inventing
quorum or hiding dissent.

## Phase 8: multi-project hub vNext

Begin the hub compatibility release and cutover described in
[Migration](migration.md). Implement project/runtime enrollment, immutable
configuration snapshots, run
requests, sync-safe event ingestion, project stores, capability scheduling,
shared-action leases, offline reconciliation, and aggregate TUI read models.
Migrate current schema-v3 hub data behind a compatibility release.

**Gate:** two Runtimes execute and synchronize independent offline runs but
cannot perform conflicting shared mutable actions without fencing.

## Phase 9: context and reviewed improvement

Implement memory revisions, local bounded replicas, role-aware context,
evidence-linked candidates, protected evaluation, Git patch promotion, and
revision-aware effectiveness statistics.

**Gate:** a candidate is evaluated, reviewed through Git, activated only for a
future run, and measured against its declared outcome.

## Phase 10: web dashboard

Build project, Runtime, run, configuration, repository, model, timing, cost,
artifact, memory, and improvement views from the same read models and command
APIs as the TUI. Add TLS and RBAC before non-loopback deployment.

**Gate:** every web mutation is audited and reproducible through the command
API; no web-only workflow logic exists.

## Phase 11: harnesses and strong isolation

Add Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and generic process adapters; container/OS
isolation; persistent outbound remote Runtimes; multi-user RBAC; and explicit
high-availability/takeover fencing.

**Gate:** unsupported capabilities fail explicitly and no adapter weakens the
common result, effect, secret, or recovery contracts.

## Cross-cutting test gates

Every phase adds:

- unit and schema tests;
- property/model tests for state machines;
- forced-crash and duplicate-command tests;
- Windows and Linux path/process tests;
- cross-project security tests;
- redaction and no-secret-output tests;
- opt-in real harness/external integration tests where deterministic fakes are
  insufficient;
- documentation and migration updates in the same change.

Generated package artifacts remain reproducible and the existing `npm run
validate` gate remains green throughout migration.
